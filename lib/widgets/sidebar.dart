/// This file is deliberately IDENTICAL in all of the apps. Nothing in it
/// imports a per-app theme: the colours and metrics arrive as a
/// [SidebarStyle], which each app builds from its own theme file. Before
/// this, four front ends had four rails -- one decoupled, one that imported
/// its category enum from workbench_screen.dart (and so could not be reused
/// or unit-tested), one private class inlined in a screen, and one with a
/// different name and API again. Any fix had to be made four times and
/// usually was not.
///
/// Sizing is measured, not hardcoded. LauncherLayoutHelper.createLauncher in
/// the Android original also sized this rail from its content (widest
/// measured label, floored at dp(88), capped at dp(150)/a quarter of the
/// screen); an earlier pass pinned it at a flat 160dp instead, which left a
/// wide dead strip to the right of every label on a 853dp-wide device -- and,
/// worse, ignored the platform text scale entirely, so at the Retroid's 1.35x
/// font scale the labels were far too big for the fixed 36dp rows. Both are
/// computed here:
///   - width  = icon column + widest measured title + paddings, clamped
///   - height = text height + vertical padding, floored at a touch target
